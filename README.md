#  Parking Management System

A **desktop application** that simulates a **smart parking system** inside the VIT campus, built using **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.  
This project aims to provide an efficient parking allocation mechanism that minimizes congestion, reduces time spent searching for parking, and optimizes slot utilization.

##  Problem Statement

- Parking inside the VIT campus is often hectic and difficult during peak hours.  
- Faculty waste valuable time searching for available parking spaces.  
- Lack of a proper management system causes congestion, confusion, and inefficient space utilization.  
- There is a need for a **smart parking manager** to streamline and automate parking operations inside the campus.

##  Proposed Solution

A **desktop application** that:
- Simulates a **smart car parking system**.
- Utilizes **Data Structures & Algorithms** for efficient slot allocation and searching.
- Provides a **GUI-based visualization** of parking slots.
- Reduces dependency on staff/security and helps avoid congestion.

##  Core Features

-  **Park a Car** — Allocates the nearest available slot using DSA-based logic.  
-  **Remove a Car** — Frees up the occupied slot efficiently.  
-  **Display Parking Status** — Shows which slots are occupied or available.  
-  **Suggest Nearest Available Slot** — Helps users find the closest parking spot quickly.

---

##  Future Enhancements

-  GUI visualization of parking slots using **Java Swing**.  
-  Search functionality to locate cars by their **number plate**.  
-  Support for **multiple entry gates** and smart slot allocation based on the user’s preferred block/location.  
-  Real-time slot tracking and optimization algorithms for dynamic parking areas.

##  Data Structures & Algorithms Used

- **Queues / Stacks** — For managing entry and exit sequences.  
- **Priority Queue / Heap** — To allocate the nearest available slot efficiently.  
- **Hash Maps** — For quick lookup of car numbers and slot mapping.  
- **Graphs / Trees** *(planned)* — For modeling multi-gate smart allocation.

- **Language:** Java  
- **Concepts:** Data Structures and Algorithms  
- **GUI Framework (Future):** Java Swing  
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code / IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse
